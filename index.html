                </a>
                User interview is the first step in the development plan for my portfolio. The purpose of the user interview is to understand the need for the users. Thus, most of the interview questions are focusing on the portfolio’s features that benefit the users. The questions are used to explore what kind of feature, how the features bring benefit to users, in which style do the users want to see. Based on the analysis of the interview result, I can correctly prioritize each feature from low to high. This helps speed up my development. I can eliminate features, which were on my list, that are not used in order to focus on developing the ones that really bring benefits to both users and myself.</p>

                    <h3>Competitor Analysis <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></h3>
                </a>
                The purpose of competitor analysis is to understand the strength and weakness of my portfolio. Most of my competitors are personal portfolio. They are very look-a-like to what I have been developing for my portfolio. Thus, I can see many similarities and improvement, which can be done for my portfolio. Throughout the competitor analysis, I was able to identify the elements that my portfolio is still lacking. Moreover, I can keep improving on the features that can make my portfolio more success.</p>

                    <h3>Feature Value Matrix <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></h3>
                </a>
               Feature value matrix is the analysis of all features that I decide to have in my portfolio. I have identified more than 10 features that I am going to implement in my portfolio. Most of the features are selected by conducting the user interviews. These features are going to fulfill the minimal requirement for a portfolio. In addition, they will help maintain the user’s interests on my portfolio.</p>

                    <h3>Feature Prioritization <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></h3>
                </a>
                Feature prioritization is decided on three main categories: user value, business value and development effort value. Each feature has its rating for each category from 1 to 5 (5 = lowest, 1 = highest). Then, the one with lowest total value (3 = best) will be picked and organized on the Feature Prioritization chart. Most of the basic features such as mobile compatibility, photo, contact, social media, etc… I was able to incorporate them into my portfolio. There are more features that can improve my portfolio such as photo slideshows, project demos, which I didn’t implement on my portfolio because of time constraint and special skills requirements. These features will be added in the future.</p>

                </a>
                User stories are scenarios that will happen during the users visits my portfolio. I view the user stories as test cases that I can use to test different features of my portfolio. I created the user stories based on the user research. It reflects the facts I found from different interviewees during the user interview, and the information from competitor analysis. The user stories are conducted on different type of users such hiring managers, recruiters, college professors, friends and family members.</p>

                    <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></h3>
                </a>
                Cognitive walkthrough is to ensure the implemented features are working properly to achieve the goals. For me, conducting cognitive walkthrough is the best opportunity to have real conversation with the interviewee and receive feedback right away. I can see where they are focusing on, what make them distract or hard to navigate. I can also acknowledge if they understand the tasks they just did. Cognitive walkthrough is very easy to do. The only challenges I faced is to find the right people I want to interview.</p>

                    <h3>User Test</h3>
                </a>
                For user test, I chose to do a five-second test, a question test, and a navigation test. The five-second test is to see if the site is obvious for people to know it is a portfolio. Also, to see what impress users the most. Another test is a question test. In this test, I asked more questions about my portfolio in order to get feedback on the layout. The last test is a navigation test. This is used to examine whether I have done a good job on UX.
