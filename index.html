                    </a>
                    User interview is the first step in the development plan for my portfolio. The purpose of the user interview is to understand the need for the users. Thus, most of the interview questions are focusing on the portfolio’s features that benefit the users. The questions are used to explore what kind of feature, how the features bring benefit to users, in which style do the users want to see. Based on the analysis of the interview result, I can correctly prioritize each feature from low to high. This helps speed up my development. I can eliminate features, which were on my list, that are not used in order to focus on developing the ones that really bring benefits to both users and myself.</p>

                    The purpose of competitor analysis is to understand the strength and weakness of my portfolio. Most of my competitors are personal portfolio. They are very look-a-like to what I have been developing for my portfolio. Thus, I can see many similarities and improvement, which can be done for my portfolio. Throughout the competitor analysis, I was able to identify the elements that my portfolio is still lacking. Moreover, I can keep improving on the features that can make my portfolio more success.</p>

                    Feature value matrix is the analysis of all features that I decide to have in my portfolio. I have identified more than 10 features that I am going to implement in my portfolio. Most of the features are selected by conducting the user interviews. These features are going to fulfill the minimal requirement for a portfolio. In addition, they will help maintain the user’s interests on my portfolio.</p>

                    </a>
                    Feature prioritization is decided on three main categories: user value, business value and development effort value. Each feature has its rating for each category from 1 to 5 (5 = lowest, 1 = highest). Then, the one with lowest total value (3 = best) will be picked and organized on the Feature Prioritization chart. Most of the basic features such as mobile compatibility, photo, contact, social media, etc… I was able to incorporate them into my portfolio. There are more features that can improve my portfolio such as photo slideshows, project demos, which I didn’t implement on my portfolio because of time constraint and special skills requirements. These features will be added in the future.</p>

                    User stories are scenarios that will happen during the users visits my portfolio. I view the user stories as test cases that I can use to test different features of my portfolio. I created the user stories based on the user research. It reflects the facts I found from different interviewees during the user interview, and the information from competitor analysis. The user stories are conducted on different type of users such hiring managers, recruiters, college professors, friends and family members.</p>

                    Cognitive walkthrough is to ensure the implemented features are working properly to achieve the goals. For me, conducting cognitive walkthrough is the best opportunity to have real conversation with the interviewee and receive feedback right away. I can see where they are focusing on, what make them distract or hard to navigate. I can also acknowledge if they understand the tasks they just did. Cognitive walkthrough is very easy to do. The only challenges I faced is to find the right people I want to interview.</p>

                    </a>
                    For user test, I chose to do a five-second test, a question test, and a navigation test. The five-second test is to see if the site is obvious for people to know it is a portfolio. Also, to see what impress users the most. Another test is a question test. In this test, I asked more questions about my portfolio in order to get feedback on the layout. The last test is a navigation test. This is used to examine whether I have done a good job on UX.

                <p>
                    Throughout the development of my portfolio, I find that designing a website is more fun than I thought. First, it is very challenging for an inexperienced developer like me to start designing my portfolio. It was very excited at the beginning and I tried to set a high expectation for my portfolio. I was thinking of a fancy, colorful, and built with interactive activities. However, due to time constraints and lack of skills, my goals have not been accomplished. The development was harder than its look. I had to begin from scratch and looked up for code on Google. However, there are so many sources, many of them are outdated and bad exercises. I got to follow some of these bad experience, but I changed as soon as I got more understanding of the work I was doing.<br><br> Moreover, I found that doing user research and user testing is very important for the development of my portfolio. My goals are changed after I had completed the user research. The majority of users expect to see a simple Portfolio. They expect to see the basic features of a portfolio (email, resume, contact) are well implemented more than interactive or colorful design. However, when I was working on my portfolio, the more I tried to make it look simple, the more I made it more complicated. I didn’t realize that until I had conducted the user testing. Based on the user testing, my portfolio is found too complicated because of its layout. Most users don’t like the background color or the spacing of text. Some of the background colors and elements I implemented to make my portfolio look cooler are actually distracting the users. Moreover, I found that some of the features didn’t work correctly as intended. The mobile layout didn’t work on small screen size (about 3-4”). The navigation bar didn’t close after expanding. <br><br> In conclusion, user research and user testing are the most important factors that affect my portfolio design. The more information I can collect from doing user research, my website/portfolios are more fit to satisfy the user’s need. In addition, after complete the prototype, user testing is the best way to collect feedback from users to see what is working properly, what is not. Thus, I can learn to refine my skills to create a better design.

                <p>
                    Throughout the user research and user interview, I found that I still need to work harder to improve my portfolio. I plan to change the layout of my portfolio. I will make it look simple with three major color light gray, black, and white. I will remove any images and background colors that found distracting users. In addition, text font and spacing will be re-consider based on research I have found over the past weeks. <br><br> Moreover, I plan to enhance the user experience and user interface for the mobile design of my portfolio. The first feature is the navigation bar. This is the most important element of any website. I will rewrite the javascript to create a more responsive dropdown menu. It will be a hamburger button on the right top most corner. The menu will appear when users hover and disappear when they click on selected options.<br><br> After looking at other student’s portfolios, I found that my portfolio is too plain. This is my portfolio, so I need to design however it will show my characteristic and my passion. I am a fan of anime and a traveler, so I plan to add more sections such as “hobby”, “routine” to express my interests and personality. However, with my current skill level and knowledge, it won’t be completed any time soon. I have to do more research and refine my skills to accomplish the plan I have.
